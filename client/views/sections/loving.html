        <p>My heart is always been at the back-end side. I´ve always been amazed about design patterns and the art of making growing software modular and scalable. I never had any special feeling about the UI side.
        
        <p>And then, a few years ago, a huge technological revolution has changed things, right?.<br>
        The world has reinvented itself, with all kind of screen sizes moving arround, and all connected by a cloud that has inclredibly grown in capabilities.<br>
        So many kind of devices, so many new concepts to be created.<br>
        Reaching a point that the art of UX has been inevitably stablished and web development has become something with tremendous potential. With plenty of new frameworks that provide us a way to reach this potential.

        <p>We all have had very nice ideas. And enjoy searching for them. 
        But sooner or later everyone learns that there is no idea without its execution.
        So a couple of years ago I decided I´d love to be able to execute anyting could came to my mind.
        And so I decided to learn the Full-Stack.
        And this is what I enjoy today and I am focused doing it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_%28software_bundle%29" target="_blank_">MEAN</a>.
        
        <p>And of course everything changes and I am sure there are plenty of projects that have nothing to do with MEAN that I´d love to be part of, so I am all ears. But this is what I love to do today:
        <ul class="list-unstyled list-text">
            <li>I enjoy with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank_">AngularJS</a> especially now that I´ve gone deep into the framework, now that I completely understand the pourpose its components, when to use what and when not to. And even more important: to see its limitations.</li>
            <li>I admire their decision for such a radical change at <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank_">AngularJS 2</a>, getting rid of so many basic components and concepts of the first framework. I think it´s what was needed and I am looking forward to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I like pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank_">REST APIs</a> architecture for CRUD apps and I enjoy developing them with <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank_">Express</a>.</li>
            <li>I am pleased by storing data rich structures in <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank_">MongoDB</a> without actually caring about what and how those structures are.</li>
            <li>And although I´ll always love OOP, I have to admit that it is kind of cool developing with <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank_">NodeJS</a> a Back-end that works concurrenty and in the same language as my Front-end.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And I don´t remember my self to enjoy creating software as I do it right now, and that´s why I am sure I´ll be a grate asset.
