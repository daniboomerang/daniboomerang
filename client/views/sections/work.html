		<p>Just before I started my period as a Freelancer, I had the grate opportunity to work at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_IT_Group" target="_blank_">Amadeus</a>.<br>
		A huge company that develops worldwide products. The biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_CRS" target="_blank_">GDS</a> of the world with multiple projects where the reusability of code is essential.<br>
		Millions of lines of code where the mastery of dessign is a basic requirement for a propper mainteinance of the software.<br>
		Releases of multiple Change Requests where without a very robust and stric process of Integration and QA, everything would just blow up without any possible way to keep this propertly functioning.
		
		<p>And althought at some point I´ve seen I´d rather create a simple thing from scratch that belonging to something already existing complex and big, those almost 3 years gave me the oportunity to work in the world of the gigants, and that provided me an expertise that has a grate value for me now.

		<p>I´ve got the chance to learn everything behind the processes and methodologies of an enormous company and understand the why of all of it as well as the tools needed. <br>
		To understand the importance of INT phases, to suffer broken builds, to go through strict QA phases, to deal with production servers, with production indicences, to maintain the code written...

		<p>I had the opportunity to work in a multicultural environment with decens of nationalities and learn fluently my third language. Improve my comunication skills, get use to make presentations, write documentation and so much more...<br>

		<p>So...after that period of...traditional way of working I decided to jump into modern frameworks and agile methodologies.
		I wanted to deal with every aspect needed since the idea is conceived until it is released into a prouction server:
		<ul class="list-unstyled list-text">
            <li>To chose the Back-end technology and the server or Framework that best fits with the real needs of the app.
            <!--I had contact with Ruby on Rails and Sinatra (Ruby) and ExpressJS (NodeJS).--></li>
            <li>Same for the database. <!--I´ve done things with PostgradeSQL and MongoDB--></li>
            <li>The architecture.</li>
            <li>The task automation. <!--Grunt--></li>
            <li>The Front-end Framework. <!--Angular--> </li>  
            <li>Ensuring the Quality of the software: </li>
            <ul class="list-unstyled sublist-text">
 				<li>Unit testing both Back-end and Front-end.</li>
 				<li>E2E testing the app.</li>
            	<li>Having a Continuous Integration server.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Caring about performance:</li>
            <ul class="list-unstyled sublist-text">
 				<li>CSS over JS.</li>
 				<li>Understanding the limitations of Angular.</li>
 				<li>Loading content dynamically, optimizing images, etc.</li>
            </ul>    
            <li>Graphic Design and UX.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have done several things as Freelancer. Small projects to get the experience I was looking for. From my <a href="http://synoptic-demo-v2.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank_">first app with Angular</a> (In order to test the performance of Angular modifying properties of SVG images for a semi real-time app) to a traditional Blog (Angularjs + RoR + PostgresSQL).<br>
        From a very simple self-kickstarter site (What I believe would be a nice idea for Spotify) to an Incidence and Inventory Management tool where I had to deal with multiple Roled-based users access <a href="http://passportjs.org/" target="_blank_">(Passport)</a>, user notifications (in-app and email), statistics and reporting <a href="http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js" target="_blank_">(Angular Chart)</a> and <a href="http://bouil.github.io/angular-google-chart" target="_blank_">(Angular Google Chart)</a>, localization
         <a href="https://angular-translate.github.io/" target="_blank_">(Angular Translate)</a>, nested views and URL states <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router" target="_blank_">(AngularUI Router)</a> and more...

        <p>What you´re seing right now!.
        With a pure CSS parallax able to simulate 4 levels of profoundity, it pretends to be kind of a CV. An interactive way to show the technologies frameworks and programing languages I know. The freelancer creating and observing the world of connectivity from another perspective, servers and clients connected to the cloud...<br>
        I´ve created daniboomerang for several reasons:
		<ul class="list-unstyled list-text">
        	<li>The main one was to have something where I could clearly show what I´m capable of and how do I do things. You can see the code. You can install the app locally and do whatever pleases you.</li>
        	<li>But I also had a challenge since a long time ago: to do something I´d love to see from the Graphyc Designing and UX point of view. Also create my own images.</li>
        	<li>I wanted something fully responsive. From 200px up to TVs. Something alive that understand that you are using a very small screen and things need to be arranged in a different way.</li>
        	<li>I wanted something completelly tested. With plenty of tests, all of them <span style="color:green">passed</span>.</li>
        	<li>A Continuous Integration server</li>
        	<li>Achive grate performance: with over 40 SVG images simulating parallax, changing the background position with JS wasn´t possible. Using a pure CSS parallax solution and optimizing images (total < 6MB) was the ony way to reach a smooth scroll</li>
        </ul>

		<p>Lately I´ve been asked for giving Angular courses.<br>
		And it´s being amazing. I´ve really enjoyed preparing the courses. How to fit best the students´ expectations with the nature of the course.<br>
		It is endeed not an easy task and takes plenty of time to prepare the whole material. But I have to say that after almost 2 years using Angular the need to enquire on detail about theorical and specific features of the FRW has helped me to stabish multiple concepts I wasn´t 100% understanding. And of course you always learn new ones...<br>
		Mixing docency and practice is a great combination to reach profund comprehension.<br>
